# JS Project Proposal: ChickenBells

## Background

Chickenbells is a slight variation on the classic game by the independent developer Orisinal, itself a variation on the infinitely jumping upwards on platforms genre.

User is a chicken, jumping on an egg, trying to get to the top. Touching an egg will catapult the chicken upwards into the air far enough to reach the next piece egg, but if it doesn't get there before it falls below the line, the game is over.

## Functionality & MVP

Users control the chicken with the mouse, moving side to side trying to touch a piece of feed.

Game keeps track of high scores, and allows users to reset the game state after losing.

This game will include an instructions popup on original game load explaining the rules and controls, as well as a nice production readme with details.
